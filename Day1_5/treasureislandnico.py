#input('You\'re at a crossroad, where do you want to go? Typpe "left" or "right").lower()
#.lower() at the end can convert the entire input into a lowercase input
#\before a ' negates it
#if choice1 == "left":
#Continue in the game.
#if choice1 == "right: (better option to set the failure as the if and the else as the check point)
#print("You fell into a hole. Game over.")
